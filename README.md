# UIClickerImgEffectsPlugin
Image effects plugin for UIClicker.

This is useful to blur both the background bitmap and the searched bitmaps before executing a FindSubControl action, in order to get them closer from the matching perspective, when they have different antialiasing algorithms.

It may also happen that the background image is changed to grayscale. This plugin helps to mange that case as well.
